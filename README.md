# About Model-View-Controller:

MVC is a software design pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. 
MVC stands for Model, View and Controller. 
It separates application into three components - Model, View and Controller.

Model : The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.[5] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

View : Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants

Controller : Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
